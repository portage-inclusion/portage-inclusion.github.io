Hi, I'm Trent

Two things people notice about me right away: I'm passionate about inclusion, and I'm very Canadian. Neither of which I could picture my life without. 


In 2023, in my early 30s, I discovered I was autistic - a realization that, while surprising at first, made perfect sense. Looking back, I see a lifetime of autistic experiences and the wealth of knowledge that comes with it. My journey doesn't fit the mold most people see autism fitting; I've captained hockey and lacrosse teams, always been social, and excelled in school. Most notably, I've moved thousands of kilometers—from Toronto to the East Coast for university, then to the West Coast, and finally to Yorkshire, where I've been fortunate to call West Yorkshire home since late 2019. Where my partner and I are settled along the Leeds to Liverpool Canal.\
 *Fun fact: I currently live closer to my Canadian Uni here in Yorkshire than I did when I lived out West!*


Travel, exploration, and sports have always been passions of mine that I love to share. From coaching sports as a teenager to inviting friends on camping trips, bike tours, hikes and city breaks, I've always enjoyed sharing these experiences with others. I see it as my responsibility to use my knowledge and skills to open doors for others to engage with these brilliant spaces—whether it's bike touring and brewery hopping around Washington State, kayaking in the Atlantic, or exploring everything the UK and Switzerland have to offer. I'm fortunate to visit these places, and I believe everyone should have the chance to enjoy them too.

This passion for inclusion naturally extended into my professional life. My specialty has been supporting disabled individuals in joining their peers in recreation. I've worked with various settings—sports clubs, charities, council projects, schools, and more—providing bespoke workshops, audits, and resources to refine their vision of disability and inclusion. By making learning feel genuine, approachable, and well-intentioned, I help others embrace change and create more inclusive environments.


I'm thrilled to expand this work with Portage Inclusion, supporting more community and adult spaces—from breweries and cafes to bars and recreation clubs. Together, we can create environments where everyone feels welcome and valued.
