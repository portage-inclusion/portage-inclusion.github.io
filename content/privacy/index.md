Cats are fascinating creatures. They are independent, curious, and often quite playful. But what do cats do when it's raining outside?

One thing that cats love to do is to watch the rain from a window. They will often sit on a windowsill and stare out at the rain, mesmerized by the way it falls.

Cats also enjoy playing in the rain. They will often chase raindrops or try to catch them with their paws.

Of course, not all cats like the rain. Some cats prefer to stay indoors when it's raining. If your cat is one of these, you can provide them with a cozy place to relax, such as a bed or a blanket.

No matter what your cat's preferences are, it's important to make sure that they have a safe and comfortable place to stay during a rainstorm.

**Here are some tips for keeping your cat safe during a rainstorm:**

* Make sure that your cat has access to fresh water.
* Provide your cat with a litter box that is clean and accessible.
* Keep your cat indoors during a thunderstorm.
* If your cat is outside, bring them inside before the storm starts.
* If you have to leave your cat outside, make sure that they have a dry and sheltered place to stay.
