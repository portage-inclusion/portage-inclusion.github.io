Hi, I'm Trent

Portage Inclusion Solutions was founded on the principle that inclusion is a fundamental right, not just a goal. We are passionate about empowering individuals to fully participate in all aspects of life, from joining clubs and excelling at work to enjoying community events. 

**We believe everyone deserves these everyday joys.** Therefore, we partner with clients to unlock the full potential of their teams and communities, ensuring equitable participation for all.

Creating truly inclusive environments requires more than policy changes; it demands a shift in mindset and a commitment to valuing individual differences. While this journey can seem challenging, we provide expert guidance towards sustainable, long-term change. Leveraging our extensive experience in accessibility, neurodiversity, and inclusive practices, we deliver tailored consulting and training solutions that drive tangible results.

With approximately 20% of the UK population identifying as disabled, the need for inclusive practices is clear. We help you lower barriers to entry for employees, customers, friends, and family, ensuring everyone feels welcome and valued.
