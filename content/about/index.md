Portage Inclusion Solutions was founded on the belief that inclusion is a fundamental right, not just a goal. We're passionate about empowering everyone to fully participate in lifeâ€”from excelling at work to enjoying community events.

**We believe everyone deserves these everyday joys**, so we partner with clients to unlock the full potential of their teams and communities. Our mission is to ensure equitable participation for all.

Creating truly inclusive environments goes beyond policy changes; it requires a shift in mindset and a commitment to valuing individual differences. While this journey can seem challenging, we're here to offer expert guidance towards sustainable, long-term change. With our extensive experience in accessibility, neurodiversity, and inclusive practices, we deliver tailored consulting and training solutions that drive tangible results. We also focus on building your confidence and equipping you with the know-how to continue fostering inclusion independently, ensuring that the changes you implement are lasting and impactful.

With approximately 20% of the UK population identifying as disabled, including myself, the need for inclusive practices is clear. We help you lower barriers to entry for employees, customers, friends, and family, ensuring everyone feels welcome and valued.

**Our Approach:**

* **Collaborative Partnership:** We're in this together. As your critical friend, we offer frank advice and celebrate your achievements, helping you navigate the complexities of inclusion with honesty and support.
* **Empathy and Understanding:**  We approach every project with empathy and a deep understanding of the challenges faced by individuals and organizations.
* **Practical Solutions:** We provide actionable strategies that can be implemented right away.
* **Lasting Impact:** We're committed to building long-term partnerships and fostering sustainable change. By developing a robust framework and equipping you with the know-how, we build your confidence to continue the journey towards inclusion independently.
